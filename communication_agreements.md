# Playing Well With Others: Communication Agreements
Stratumn is an organism driven by values and purpose. The values are so important that nothing else we do matters if we cannot uphold them. Luckily they’re neither terribly controversial nor rare. Stratumn’s core values are:


  - **Altruism**: we are doing this work for the benefit of all, as a public good
  - **Empathy**: we understand the disruptive potential of the work we are doing, and work with awareness of our work affects others
  - **Openness**: willingness to step back, and help each other see things from a new perspective


## Communication Guidelines

We translate our core values into three major communication guidelines, to revisit regularly so they naturally emerge in challenging situations:

- **Humility**: Am I aware of how my thoughts, communication, and actions affect others, regardless of my intentions?
- **Compassion**: Am I responding to conflict and disagreement with curiosity, empathy, and compassion?
- **Fearlessness**:  Do I take responsibility for my share of the conflict I am experiencing? Will I share it my colleagues according to the Stratumn Mediation Process?


## Agreements

The aforementioned guidelines can be translated into the follow agreements. All Stratumnites agree to the following when interacting in a Stratumn context: 


- **Humility**: I seek to understand my own personal needs and feelings, and to speak and act in a way that is consistent with my highest self.
- **Compassion**: I am courteous, kind, and respectful to my colleagues, and strive to understand, nurture, and support them as whole individuals.
- **Fearlessness**: I commit to asking questions with curiosity and an open mind to gain clarity and understanding.


## Best Practices

We have each learned a different culture and vocabulary of communication during our lives. To help ground the above values, guidelines, and agreements, we suggest the following communication practices as helpful conduits to a communication style that embodies humility, compassion, and fearlessness.


- Speak from your own experiences rather than giving advice or opinions (“I once tried *x*…” instead of “You should do *x*”)
- Focus on personal needs and feelings over judgements and blame (“I am confused at how to rebuild trust” instead of “I can’t work with someone like you”)
- Maintain attentive silence when others are speaking. This also extends to thoughts and responses — plan your response after someone finishes speaking, not during.
- Ask questions to gain clarity and understanding, not rhetorically or as a weapon (“How did missing our meeting simplify your day yesterday?” rather than “How could you cancel on me at the last minute?”)
- Question yourself regularly, admit uncertainty, display vulnerability.
- Avoid creating or playing zero-sum games (where somebody must be wrong, or the “loser”)
- Accept and encourage sharing of emotions
- Look for deep, mutual interests instead of repeating negotiating positions
- When triggered, look for opportunities to practice empathy over judgement
- Avoid the “Should”, “Would”, “Could”
- Avoid the “Usually”, “Always”, “Never”
- Be specific (“You have missed 3 deadlines week” rather than “You’re always late”)
