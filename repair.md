# Proposal: Stratumn Repair (Conflict Resolution Process)

    When we feed and support our own happiness, we are nourishing our ability to love.
    That’s why to love means to learn the art of nourishing our happiness.
     
    Understanding someone’s suffering is the best gift you can give another person.
    Understanding is love’s other name. If you don’t understand, you can’t love.
    
    — Thich Nhat Hanh

Conflict is always a call to learn about each other. And as with all learning, maintaining a safe space eases and facilitates the students’ process.

Stratumn has a voluntary, four-step, peer-based mediation process (Stratumn Repair) to facilitate a smooth and successful response to conflict, and to provide stressed relationships a chance to heal through mutual understanding.

During each of the four steps, communication guidelines (“Stratumn Repair Guidelines”) are provided to the participants that, when followed, increase the likelihood of mutual understanding, and therefore, successful resolution.


## The Four Steps in Stratumn Repair

While all parties must agree to any given mediation session (they are voluntary), only one party’s initiative is necessary to begin the Repair process.

1. One party to the conflict (the host) invites the other party to the Repair process with a clear purpose or agenda, focusing on a clear statement of the host’s feelings, needs, and requests. The host then asks the guest if they would feel comfortable participating in a 1:1 repair session. If the other party agrees within 3 days, they schedule the session. If there is no agreement after 3 days, the process proceeds to step 2.

2. The host and guest have 3 days to agree on an impartial third-party mediator they both trust to help them facilitate agreement. If they cannot agree on a mediator, or the mediation fails to end in agreement, the process proceeds to step 3.

3. The host and guest have 5 days to agree on a panel of three “experts”, expert both in relevant subject-matter and having the faith of both parties as mediators. If they cannot agree on a panel, or the panel mediation fails to end in agreement, the process proceeds to step 4.

4. The final step, after three opportunities voluntary mediations, is arbitration by either the CEO or an arbitrator appointed by the CEO. If the parties are unable to come to an agreement through mediation in the presence of the arbiter, a binding solution will be imposed by the arbiter on the participants.


## Stratumn Repair Mediation Process

Professional-level mediation requires hundreds of hours of practice and a wide variety of skills. Stratumn provides any colleagues interested in mediation skills with resources to conduct further training, both on-site and off-site. We refer to [Stratumn Repair Guidelines](./repair-guidelines.md) for the very basics of how the mediator and participant should behave during the mediation.

The actual mediation process may follow this simple outline:


1. **Opening statements and reflections**. Each person answers the following questions:
    1. What brought you to mediation today?
    2. What do you hope to get out of this mediation?

    Stating observations as opposed to judgements, and avoiding inflammatory language will speed the reconciliation process. After each party’s opening statement, the other party has an opportunity to reflect what they heard the other party say. This is a crucial piece in understanding the true motivations and interests of the other party.

2. **Clarification.** If a mediator is present, they make this opportunity to ask direct, clarifying questions to the parties involved, to try to better understand the interests at stake. They may also take this opportunity to reframe parts of the clients’ opening statement.
3. **Agenda**. Both parties have an opportunity to add items to the agenda.
4. **Discussion**. Once the agenda has been built, the participants discuss its items.
5. **Caucus**. If a mediator is present and trained in conducting caucus, they may caucus (meet confidentially with each party for equal amounts of time) if they think it will aid progress.
6. **Agreement**. Any agreements are clarified and written. It is recommended that the agreements be shared with another colleague to increase accountability and follow-through.
7. **Closing**. The mediation is closed after each participant has an opportunity to share one thing they were grateful for during the mediation.
