# Stratumn Repair Guidelines
Stratumn Repair is a peer-based mediation program. The most likely scenario is that nobody involved is a professional. We therefore provide some basic guidelines to aid participants in their journey.

# Participants

When in conflict, it’s especially important to review the communication agreements and best practices (+Proposal: Communication Agreements). In addition to those agreements, participants in conflict are reminded to:


1. Communicate without relying on fear, blame, punishment, or shame. While they are all effective tools, none of those techniques lead to long term solutions unless serious power imbalances are present.
2. Remember that each person is a complicated collection of many things, and are not defined by a narrow set of their actions. 
3. Evaluate each statement and each meeting’s affect on the conflict. Are you actually trying to resolve the conflict, or do you just need to express your emotions or clarify your needs?
4. Focus on each participants’ continuing deep interests rather than arguing about each person’s version of events. Past transactions are immutable.
5. Separate observation from evaluation the other person (positively or negatively). Use “I” statements. Ask questions to learn the other persons’ views/feelings/motivations instead of making interpretations or assumptions. 
6. Finish the entire mediation process, even if there is a moment of clarity that feels cathartic. Lasting relationship change comes about from having clear agreements that both parties feel committed to. These agreements should be precise to avoid confusion.
# Mediator

Mediators facilitate agreements between participants. They do not suggest or impose agreements or solutions. Mediators are responsible for responding to the clients emotional, procedural, and substantive needs:

## Emotional - A safe space
  - Choose a neutral location and set a tone of fairness
  - Make the above list, as well as the communication best practices, available before the meeting, and restate it orally in the beginning of the meeting. As an example, put posters on the wall of the meeting room
  - Practice attentive listening and body language
  - Remind participants of respectful communication rules and intervene when necessary
  - Help the participants empathize with each other through strategic reflecting, reframing and restating.


## Procedural - A balanced process
  - Avoid any appearance of bias
  - Correct any observed power imbalances
  - Follow the mediation process outlined in +Proposal: Stratumn Repair (Conflict Resolution Process) 


## Substantive - A valuable use of time
  - Reduce confusion and distraction by employing the follow techniques:
    - Invite silence
    - Encourage the parties to separate observation from evaluation
    - Invite Role Switching
    - Invite the participants to “say-back” what they hear
    - Hold participants to +Playing Well With Others: Communication Agreements 
  - Help participants stick to the agenda
  - Focus on participant’s requests for the future, away from their stories of the past
  - Scribe the participants’ agreements and encourage them to be as clear and specific as possible.


# The Bell

With or without a mediator, we invite another “participant” to every Stratumn Repair process: The Bell.

All parties to Stratumn Repair agree to ring the bell when they feel the process is not progressing smoothly. This may be due to a process doubt, communication agreements that are not respected, a sense of being overwhelmed, or any number of other reasons.

When the bell is rung, all parties are expected to maintain silence for at least 15 seconds, after which the ringer of the bell may surface their concerns.

When participants experience a lot of emotion, the bell can be useful in giving everybody a chance to take a step back and gain a little perspective.
